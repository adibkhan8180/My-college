          <h2>WELCOME TO HVPM COET</h2>
          <p>
            The College of Engineering and Technology was established in the
            year 2002-2003 and is permanently affiliated to Sant Gadge Baba
            Amravati University, Amravati. The college is approved by AICTE, DTE
            and Maharashtra Government. <br />

            The College of Engineering and Technology, Amravati (Maharashtra),
            is an Institution having a dedicated outlook towards Quality in
            Technical Education has established in the year 2002 under Hanuman
            Vyayam Prasarak Mandal. There have been conscious and persistent
            efforts towards pursuit for excellence in the overall development of
            the students and staff. The academic schedule is so framed as to
            keep the students on toes to plan their activities beyond College
            engagements; to pursue hobbies, interests, explore career options,
            take up interesting, internships etc. <br />
            which otherwise lies beyond the ambit of technology education.
            Understanding the fact that lessons in engineering cannot be
            confined to only class room teaching, the education in this College
            has always tried to reach beyond the curriculum. A special lineup
            called Core Technical Area has been identified from miscellaneous
            courses and run scrupulously to enhance the employability skills of
            students. Recognizing, that tomorrow graduates can no more be
            contended by seeking a job, but they should be able to create jobs
            for others; students are encouraged to take a leap for Research,
            Innovation and Incubation based design approach..

            integrate technology and its range of application ‘throughout the
