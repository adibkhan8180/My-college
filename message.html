                This is age-old institution of sports and physical education in
                the country. Established in the year 1914 and celebrated its
                centenary in the year 2014. This holy place is blessed with foot
                prints of freedom fighters, social workers, social reformers of
                all the time. It has a very rich heritage promoting Indian
                traditional sport and physical culture . The activities of the
                institution blended patriotism and quality education in blood of
                its students. <br /><br />
                It is a mini India wherein you can see students right from Jammu
                & Kashmir up to Kanyakumari every year seek admission and shape
                their future in the field of sports and physical education. This
                is the first of its kind a fully developed sports complex
                established and managed by private management. <br /><br />
                The sports facilities for many competitive sports are
                indigenously developed by the Institution with coaching
                facility. We believe in the fact that “A sound mind lives in a
                sound body” therefore physical fitness training and education
                should cater together. <br />
                <br />Social responsiveness is also very essential and should
                impart in the training programme. This Institution is active in
                many social activities: The ‘Help Line’ is established to help
                any person especially Girls/Women who are in trouble. The ‘Child
                Line’ is established to help children in need. We started
                ‘Shetkari Jagruti Abhiyan’ to help the family of farmers who
                committed suicide and to boost up moral of their family members.
                <br /><br />
                Hon. Prime-Minister of India has taken note of this and
                appreciated this activity. The institution is marching ahead
                with its policies and principles. Our slogan is “Age Badho Sabse
                Age Badho”. Wishing you all the bests! <br />
